I have renamed the PNG files as you requested and pushed the changes to your GitHub repository.

Here's a summary of the steps I took:

1.  **Renamed the files:**
    -   `screenshot-2025-11-17_13-29-39.png` was renamed to `gofi_1.png`
    -   `screenshot-2025-11-17_13-31-32.png` was renamed to `gofi_2.png`
    -   `screenshot-2025-11-17_13-31-45.png` was renamed to `gofi_3.png`

2.  **Committed the changes:** I committed these renames to your local Git repository with the message "style: rename screenshot files".

3.  **Pushed the changes to GitHub:** I pushed the commit to the `main` branch of your `upstream` remote repository.

Your GitHub repository now reflects these file renames.
